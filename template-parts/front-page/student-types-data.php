<p>And worse, you’re beat up and ready to quit. </p>
<p>And maybe you should quit. </p>

		<p>But maybe you shouldn’t because maybe you never stood a chance of having sustained success from the very beginning.</p>
<p>You’re in good company.
<p>Most everyone who goes after this is destined to fail.
<p>It has nothing to do with their talent – there’s nothing more common than really talented, well-trained out-of-work actors.</p>

<p>Sanford Meisner once said to all actors:</p>
<q>This world needs you. No exaggeration there. This world actually needs you. Life beats down and crushes our souls on a daily basis and good acting, good films, good plays, reminds everyone that they have one.</q>
<p>If you still believe this world really does need you – your talent, your voice, your stories, your art – then watch this video from Jim because he agrees with you.</p>
